                I'm Wendy, a UX designer from Vancouver, Canada. I am passionate about creating insight-driven work to help reduce the frictions in people's daily lives. In addition to designing workflows and interfaces, I enjoy prototyping, conducting usability studies, and cross-team collaborations. My previous experiences include working at Microsoft and SAP, as well as mid-sized startups and non-profit organizations.

                My mini origin story: I started web designing at the age of 11, studied graphic design in highschool, and am currently wrapping up a degree in design at Simon Fraser University. My career in design was jumpstarted by a childhood passion, and I can't wait to see where this path will take me.
