                I'm Wendy, a UX designer from Vancouver, Canada. I am passionate about creating insight-driven work to help reduce the frictions in people's daily lives. In addition to designing workflows and interfaces, I enjoy prototyping, conducting usability studies, and cross-team collaborations. My previous experiences include working at Microsoft and <a href="conversations.php">SAP</a>, as well as mid-sized startups and non-profit organizations.

                I am currently wrapping up a degree in design at Simon Fraser University. In my down time, you can find me chasing my passion in <a href="">photography</a>.
