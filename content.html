          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Wendy, a UX designer from Vancouver, Canada. I am passionate about creating insight-driven work to help make people's lives easier. In addition to designing workflows and interfaces, I enjoy prototyping, conducting usability studies, and cross-team collaborations. My previous experiences include working at Microsoft and SAP, as well as mid-sized startups and non-profit organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mini origin story: I started web designing at the age of 11, studied graphic design in highschool, and am currently wrapping up a degree in design at Simon Fraser University. My career in design was jumpstarted by a childhood passion, and I can't wait to see where this path will take me.
          </p>

          <h2>Project 1: Conversations for SAP Jam</h2>
          <p>
            During my internship at SAP, one of my projects was to revamp the Private Messages feature (which has been renamed to “Conversations”) for SAP Jam Collaboration. This feature is currently modeled after e-mail and allows people to contact each other directly. The goal is to make the feature real time, bot-friendly, and have a lightweight UI that is easy to start and continue conversations in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working closely with another UX designer, the Development team and the lead Product Manager, my roles in this project were UI design, art direction, and usability testing.
          </p>
            Initially the scope was much larger and included the ability for users to have multiple live conversations without interrupting their workflow. I explored how chat popovers would appear on the screen, different points of entry, and the workflow of starting a conversation.

          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually the project was de-scoped so that it only focused on revamping the features that already existed in the current product. As a result, the project was limited to the Private Messages page only.
          </p>
          <p>
            While another UX designer worked on the workflow for creating new conversations, I focused on the visual design and art direction of the new UI. I purposely split the interface into two components to push myself to think in a mobile-first approach. This also allowed me to keep in mind how the chat popovers (for a future scope) could look.
            [include sketches]
          </p>
          <p>
            I then produced high fidelity mockups to produce different visual treatments. Some of the key elements I considered included speech bubbles, unread message indicators, time stamps, profile photos, and the reply box.
            [include mockups]
          </p>
          <p>
            The conversation creation process happens within the Conversation List so the design will be more responsive on mobile web. Using a simple prototype, another designer and I tested two different workflows for creating a group conversation. Six of our eight participants preferred Workflow B, so this is the workflow we decided to go with.

          </p>
          <p>
            After performing an audit of the existing UI patterns on SAP Jam, I selected the design below as it is the most consistent with the product.
            [include mockups + workflows]
          </p>
          <p>
            This design was reviewed by both the lead Product Manager and the Director of UX. Working closely with the Development team, I created documentations for both the workflow and UI specifications to guide them as they implemented the feature. Two lead Developers and I then demoed the revamped Conversations feature to several company stakeholders, including Product Managers, Sales, and Customer Support.
