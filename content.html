          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Wendy, a UX designer from Vancouver, Canada. I am passionate about creating insight-driven work to help make people's lives easier. In addition to designing workflows and interfaces, I enjoy prototyping, conducting usability studies, and cross-team collaborations. My previous experiences include working at Microsoft and SAP, as well as mid-sized startups and non-profit organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mini origin story: I started web designing at the age of 11, studied graphic design in highschool, and am currently wrapping up a degree in design at Simon Fraser University. My career in design was jumpstarted by a childhood passion, and I can't wait to see where this path will take me.
          </p>

          <h2>Project 1: Conversations for SAP Jam</h2>
          <p>
            During my internship at SAP, one of my projects was to revamp the Private Messages feature (which has been renamed to “Conversations”) for SAP Jam Collaboration. This feature is currently modeled after e-mail and allows people to contact each other directly. The goal is to make the feature real time, bot-friendly, and have a lightweight UI that is easy to start and continue conversations in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working closely with another UX designer, the Development team and the lead Product Manager, my roles in this project were UI design, art direction, and usability testing.
          </p>
            Initially the scope was much larger and included the ability for users to have multiple live conversations without interrupting their workflow. I explored how chat popovers would appear on the screen, different points of entry, and the workflow of starting a conversation.
            [include sketches]
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually the project was de-scoped so that it only focused on revamping the features that already existed in the current product. As a result, the project was limited to the Private Messages page only.
          </p>
          <p>
            While another UX designer worked on the workflow for creating new conversations, I focused on the visual design and art direction of the new UI. I purposely split the interface into two components to push myself to think in a mobile-first approach. This also allowed me to keep in mind how the chat popovers (for a future scope) could look.
            [include sketches]
          </p>
          <p>
            I then produced high fidelity mockups to produce different visual treatments. Some of the key elements I considered included speech bubbles, unread message indicators, time stamps, profile photos, and the reply box.
            [include mockups]
          </p>
          <p>
            The conversation creation process happens within the Conversation List so the design will be more responsive on mobile web. Using a simple prototype, another designer and I tested two different workflows for creating a group conversation. Six of our eight participants preferred Workflow B, so this is the workflow we decided to go with.

          </p>
          <p>
            After performing an audit of the existing UI patterns on SAP Jam, I selected the design below as it is the most consistent with the product.
            [include mockups + workflows]
          </p>
          <p>
            This design was reviewed by both the lead Product Manager and the Director of UX. Working closely with the Development team, I created documentations for both the workflow and UI specifications to guide them as they implemented the feature. Two lead Developers and I then demoed the revamped Conversations feature to several company stakeholders, including Product Managers, Sales, and Customer Support.

          <h2>MakerLabs</h2>
          <p>
            In a design research project for school, my team and I worked closely with a Vancouver-based company, MakerLabs, for 12 weeks a proposed a website redesign for them to improve the discoverability of their services.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was the main point of contact with the client, and my design roles included ethnographic research, UI design, prototyping, and filming.
          </p>
          <p>
            MakerLabs is a makerspace based around the idea of tool sharing. It offers 4 main services: education, membership, studios, and fabrication.
            [include photo]
          </p>
          <p>
            Our proposal was to highlight these four services so customers can easily discover and learn about them. Our primary focus was on fabrication as we identified several pain points and opportunities from our research.
          </p>
          <p>
            We engaged with several groups of people in MakerLabs, including the CEO, community managers, fabricators, and members. In the first few weeks, we conducted research methods like interviews, job shadowing, and filming. In each visit, I would report our findings to the CEO on the different opportunities we identified, and this led them to take initiative on several of these opportunites and business problem.
            [include photos]
          </p>
          <p>
            We then created three cultural probe kits to get a better understanding of our client as a way to draw inspiration, and left these kits with them for a week. They are meant to feel like a gift, not a chore, so we made four activities with a crafty feel.
            [include photos]
          </p>
          <p>
            Our major finding was that The MakerLabs team wants to invest more resources into the growth of the company, however, they spend a large portion of their time responding to emails and providing answers that are already on the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We narrowed down our design focus and decided we want to help MakerLabs improve the way in which they communicate their identity and services to potential customers as well as how they handle customer inquiries.
          </p>
          <p>
            We proposed a web redesign because the current website was causing several pain points. It has a lot of emphasis on education and membership but offers no benefits for renting studios. Information on fabrication was almost non-existent. There were no form or guidelines for getting a quote, which caused several redundant e-mails. Alot of times, it takes 20 e-mails between the customer & MakerLabs just to get a quote. It doesn't communicate the creative and diverse community MakerLabs has.
