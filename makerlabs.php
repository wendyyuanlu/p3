                Our major finding was that the MakerLabs team wants to invest more resources into the growth of the company, however, they spend a large portion of their time responding to emails and providing answers that are already on the website.
              </p>
              <p>
                We narrowed down our design focus and decided <strong>we want to help MakerLabs improve the way in which they communicate their identity and services to potential customers as well as how they handle customer inquiries</strong>.

              <p>
                We held a workshop with four members of the MakerLabs team as a way to co-design with our clients. Our goal was to learn about the inquiries they receive from customers, the causes of long e-mail threads, and how the hierarchy of information on their website should be structured.

            <div class="narrow">
              <p>
                We found that the MakerLabs staff often have to answer questions (both in person and over e-mail) that are already available on their website because customers are unable to find them. Furthermore, their long e-mail threads often revolve around providing quotes for outsourced projects because customers usually do not provide enough detail in their e-mails.

              <p>
                We proposed a web redesign because the current website was causing several pain points, as illustrated below. It places strong emphasis on education and membership but offers no benefits for renting studios. Information on fabrication was almost non-existent and there were no form or guidelines for getting a quote, thus resulting in several redundant e-mails. Furthermore, the website doesn't communicate the creative and diverse community MakerLabs has.

                Out of all of MakerLabs' services, we primarily focused on fabrication because we identified several pain points and opportunities in this area during our research process. In particular, we focused on the process of submitting a request for a quote so that we could reduce the amount of redundant e-mails and improve response time.

                  We presented our concept to the MakerLabs team, including all of the stakeholders we worked closely with throughout the project.

                  Some of largest takeaways for me in this project is working with a client that my team and I had no prior connection with. As the main point of contact with the client, I learned how to pitch myself to a client, how to effectively communicate with them throughout a project, how to propose a concept to them, as well as how to be sensitive when discussing business problems or opportunities.

                  <!-- Having no prior connection with MakerLabs, approaching and convincing them to participate in our project was one of our largest challenges. We met with the CEO and pitched ourselves as design consultants. I explained that our research-driven project will help them discover new perspectives on their business process, and based on the business opportunities we may discover, we will propose and prototype a concept to them. Despite being a nerve wracking experience, it was successful and we dove into the research process. -->
